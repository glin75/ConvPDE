# Generating PDE Datasets

## Dataset Format
The datasets generated by the code provided in the `Setup/` directories for each example are organized into `mesh_*.npy`, `data_*.npy`, and `solutions_*.npy` files stored in the `Meshes/`, `Data/`, and `Solutions/` subdirectories, respectively.  The `Variable_Coefficient` problem setup generates additional `coeff_*.npy` terms which are also stored in the `Data/` subdirectory.

Each of the stored numpy arrays corresponds to a discretization of the continuous functions associated with a given PDE system and are formatted as fixed 128x128 resolution arrays.  The mesh files are encoded as integer-valued arrays with values of zero outside of the domain, values of one throughout the interior of the domain, and values of two along the boundary; these files are used to adapt the loss function to the specific domains in consideration during training.

The NumPy arrays are then preprocessed, consolidated, and stored in the TFRecord format in the `Setup/DATA/` subdirectories.  An 80/20 split of the dataset is used to create training/validation sets; the training and validation indices are stored in the `Setup/DATA/t_indices.npy` and `Setup/DATA/v_indices.npy` files, respectively.


    
## Generating the Dataset
The files for dataset creation are stored in the `Setup/` subdirectories for each problem setup.  Various dataset parameters (e.g. the total number of examples to create) are available in the `flags.py` files.

The predefined settings assume that 8 CPUs are available.  The Python [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html) package is used to parallelize the dataset creation procedures, and the CPU count can be adjusted using the `--cpu_count` flag.

    
Once these settings have been specified, the datasets can be generated by running the `Compute_Cholesky_Factors.py` and  `CREATE_DATASET.sh` scripts:
```console
$ python Compute_Cholesky_Factors.py
    
 [ Generating Covariances ]
    
  Progress:  100.0%

    
$ ./CREATE_DATASET.sh
    
 [ Sampling Functions ]

  Progress:  100.0%


 [ Converting Functions ]

  Progress:  100.0%


 [ Generating Meshes ]

  Progress:  100.0%


 [ Solving Systems ]

  Progress:  100.0%


 [ Preprocessing Data ]

  Progress:  100.0%

    
 [ Writing TFRecords ]

  Progress:  100.0%


 [ Cleaning XML Files ]

  Progress:  100.0%
  
```


This will create four subdirectories containing the generated dataset files:
* `Cholesky/` - contains .npy files for the Cholesky factors of covariance matrices
* `Data/` - contains .xml and .npy files for source terms
* `Meshes/` - contains .xml and .npy files for meshes
* `Solutions/` - contains .npy files for solutions

along with the preprocessed dataset example written to TFRecords files in the `./DATA/` directory.

**Note:** The `Cholesky/` files can be reused for all five problem setups (e.g. using symbolic links).
